            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>This book details the lives and work of Dr. Charles Norris and Dr. Alexander Gettler and their contributions
                    to the rise of forensic science as a field. Told through gripping tales of grisly murders, this book was science
                    and true crime to give life to the struggles of these men in Prohibition-era New York City and how they built a 
                    name for forensic science.

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                This book altered me as a person. It reads like fiction and satisfies several of my niche special interests, like
                forensic science, murder mystery, drama, history, and forensice science. While I respect the work of Dr. Norris in this book,
                I have nothing but love for the father of toxicology, Alexander Gettler, whose work is relevant and fascinating to this day.

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                This book was both entertaining and thought-provoking. It realistically portrays college students and how they struggle to
                reconcile conflicting identities. I would read this again.

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                "A very risky gamble." If you know, you know. A fast, fun, exciting read, perfect to break someone out of a book slump
                or dry spell.
